âœ… Sprint 2: Motor Driver and PWM Task â€” Step-by-Step
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Implement PWM control via an RTOS task to drive DC motors through an H-bridge (e.g., L298N).

ðŸ§° Materials Needed
Item	Notes	Required For
L298N Motor Driver Module	Or any similar dual H-bridge	Hardware testing
2x DC motors (6â€“12V typical)	Yellow gear motors are common	Hardware testing
External power supply (e.g., 9V battery pack or bench PSU)	Needed to drive motors	Hardware testing
Jumper wires & Breadboard	For prototyping connections	Hardware testing
Multimeter	(optional) to test PWM voltage	Hardware debugging

âœ… Order these now if you donâ€™t have them.

ðŸ§ª Software-Only Tasks (Can Start Now)
1. Define PWM abstraction
Decide how you'll control PWM from a task. If using Tiva C timers:

Use Timer0A or another GPTM in PWM mode.

Choose pins tied to timers capable of PWM output (e.g., PB6, PB7 for T0CCP0/1).

ðŸ“„ Reference: Tiva TM4C123 datasheet > Pin Muxing & Timer PWM modes.

2. Write PWM Setup Code
Implement a function like:

c
Copy
Edit
void PWM_Init(void);
void PWM_SetDutyCycle(uint8_t dutyPercent);  // 0-100%
Use a 1 kHz base frequency for now (configurable).

3. Create RTOS Task to Control PWM
Example task pseudocode:

c
Copy
Edit
void Task_MotorPWM(void) {
    uint8_t duty = 0;
    int8_t dir = 1;
    while (1) {
        PWM_SetDutyCycle(duty);
        duty += dir * 10;
        if (duty == 100 || duty == 0) dir *= -1;
        OS_delay(BSP_TICKS_PER_SEC / 10); // update every 100 ms
    }
}
4. Update main.c
Create stack space and start the MotorPWM thread.

Make sure it's cooperative with your other tasks or prioritize accordingly.

ðŸ”Œ Hardware-Dependent Tasks (Do After Parts Arrive)
5. Wire the L298N to the Tiva C & Motors
Typical wiring:

L298N Pin	Connects To
IN1 / IN2	GPIO outputs on Tiva
ENA	PWM output from Tiva
12V / GND	External power supply
OUT1/OUT2	Motor A terminals
5V_EN	Shorted (if powering logic from 12V rail)

ðŸ›‘ Donâ€™t power the motors from Tivaâ€™s 3.3V rail!

6. Test PWM Output with a Multimeter or LED
Before wiring up the motor, connect the PWM pin to an LED + resistor.

Verify dimming/brighting with changing duty cycle.

7. Test Full Motor Control
Use MotorPWM task to ramp up/down speed.

Add direction toggling via GPIO control of IN1/IN2.

âœ… Sprint 2 "Done" Criteria:
PWM output visibly changes duty cycle.

Motor connected to L298N spins and varies speed.

RTOS task cleanly controls speed in time slices.
